## Hi there 👋

Software & QA Engineer, Graduated 2025 from Syracuse with BS Computer Science and BA Economics. I love tackling complex problems and have a keen eye for detail. Technology excites me, especially when it comes to building innovative solutions. I'm always looking for opportunities to apply my skills and creativity in a team that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible!
